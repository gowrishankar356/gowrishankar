            <p>
              I love building web sites and interfaces that improve user
              experience. Thatâ€™s what drove me into software engineering up to
              now. Currently, I am pursuing my masters in Data Science at
              Indiana University Bloomington, with 5 months of experience as a
              Software Developer Intern at Pringle Robotics Inc. As part of my
              education, my course work includes Software Engineering, Applied
              Algorithms, Applied Database Technologies, Advanced Database
              Concepts, Elements of Artificial Intelligence, Data Mining, and
              Social Media Mining
              <br></br>
              <br></br>My Current role as a Software Developer Intern, I am
              responsible for constructing micro services both Front-End and
              Back-End using C#, .NET, MVC, SQL Server and Bootstrap. I also
              involved in building front end pages for company web applications
              using ReactJS, NextJS, and TypeScript and used the API's
              configured above. Also, I have configured micro services auto
              generator where it generates the code for Micro Services
              automatically.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>I have a previous work experience as an Oracle Associate

              include writing fast formulas for Earnings, Deductions, Accruals,
              Time Calculation and Entry rules using SQL, Pl/SQL. I also
